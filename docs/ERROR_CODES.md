# PropChain Error Codes Reference

All PropChain contracts use a unified numeric error code system. Codes are globally unique across the entire system and are grouped by contract domain.

## Code Ranges

| Range | Domain | Contract |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1–10 | Common | All contracts |
| 1001–1025 | PropertyToken | `property-token` |
| 2001–2013 | Escrow | `escrow` |
| 3001–3013 | Bridge | `bridge` |
| 4001–4012 | Oracle | `oracle` |
| 5001–5008 | Fees | `fees` |
| 6001–6013 | Compliance | `compliance_registry`, `tax-compliance` |
| 7001–7015 | DEX | `dex` |
| 8001–8013 | Governance | `governance` |
| 9001–9010 | Staking | `staking` |
| 10001–10005 | Monitoring | `monitoring` |
| 11001–11006 | EventBus | `event_bus` |
| 13001–13004 | VersionRegistry | `version-registry` |
| — | (no numeric code) | `insurance`, `proxy`, `database`, `metadata`, `third-party`, `lending`, `crowdfunding`, `identity`, `prediction-market`, `zk-compliance`, `ai-valuation`, `property-management`, `ipfs-metadata`, `access_control`, `crypto`, `di`, `factory`, `gdpr`, `analytics`, `fractional`, `sanctions`, `rental_income`, `subscription` |

Errors without a numeric code are returned as typed Rust enums and are identified by variant name in client SDKs.
